//Tips to find tables affected by MySQL ON DELETE CASCADE action
//Sometimes, it is useful to know which table is affected by the MySQL ON DELETE CASCADE  referential action when you delete data from a table. You can query this data from the referential_constraints in the information_schema  database as follows:


USE information_schema;

SELECT 
    table_name
FROM
    referential_constraints
WHERE
    constraint_schema = 'database_name'
        AND referenced_table_name = 'parent_table'
        AND delete_rule = 'CASCADE'

        
//For example, to find tables that associated with the buildings table with the CASCADE  deletion rule  in the classicmodels database,
//you use the following query:


USE information_schema;

SELECT 
    table_name
FROM
    referential_constraints
WHERE
    constraint_schema = 'classicmodels'
        AND referenced_table_name = 'buildings'
        AND delete_rule = 'CASCADE'
